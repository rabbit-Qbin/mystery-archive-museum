  )
  ```

#### 3. Build Status

- ✅ All dependencies resolved correctly
- ✅ Output generated: `dist/` directory ready for deployment

## What Was Verified

1. **Package Configuration**: @vercel/analytics is properly declared as a dependency
2. **Component Integration**: Analytics component is correctly imported and placed in the React component tree
3. **Build Process**: Full build completes without errors
4. **Framework Compatibility**: React/Vite setup matches Vercel's recommended pattern for Web Analytics

## Setup Follows Best Practices

✅ Analytics component placed at root level (in main.jsx) for capturing all page views
✅ Proper React version compatibility (18.2.0)
✅ Uses @vercel/analytics/react import (optimized for React)
✅ No route support limitations (React provides automatic route tracking)
✅ Ready for Vercel deployment with automatic route detection

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to Vercel:
1. Web Analytics will automatically enable via Vercel dashboard
2. New routes at `/_vercel/insights/*` will be created after next deployment
3. Page views and visitor data will begin tracking immediately after deployment
4. Data dashboard available at `https://vercel.com/dashboard` → Project Analytics tab

## Testing & Verification

After deployment, verify setup:
- Check browser Network tab for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests when visiting pages
- Allow 24 hours for initial data to appear in the analytics dashboard
- Monitor custom events if added (available on Pro and Enterprise plans)
